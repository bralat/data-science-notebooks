    "## LEFT JOIN EXAMPLE\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates a simple left join. We will do so by creating two dataframes. One will contain our books while the other contains the types of books. Then we will merge them into a single table so that we have the ids of the book types and book names together. After that, we will remove redundant columns and rename some.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why go through all this trouble? Well, this is most useful when you are dealing with data that is going to end up in a SQL Database. SQL is relational; that means, instead of repeating certain pieces of data throughout your database, you can store them in separate tables and link them by a unique id. You can read up on it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database)\n",
